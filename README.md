#### Google API Oauth FastAPI

To integrate FastAPI with Google Authentication, you can use Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol. This allows users to log in to your FastAPI application using their Google credentials. 

Here are some steps for using OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs: 

Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials from the Google API Console
Obtain an access token from the Google Authorization Server
Examine scopes of access granted by the user
Send the access token to an API
Refresh the access token, if necessary
